#Lesson 2 of the Regression Models Course on Swirl: Residuals
#This Daily R lesson is related to Sep20
#The data used is still available at swirl or John Verzani's website, http://wiener.math.csi.cuny.edu/UsingR/
#Regenerate regression line and call it "fit"
> fit <- lm(child ~ parent, galton)

#Using the function "summary" to see a display of the regression data
> summary(fit)

#Checking the mean of fit$residuals, to see if it's close to 0
> mean(fit$residuals)

#Checking the correlation between the residuals and the predictors, to see if is it close to 0
> cov(fit$residuals, galton$parent)

#Two R functions: "est" calculates a child's heights using the line defined by the two parameters (slope and intercept), and the parent's heights in the galton data as x-coordinates
#The function "sqe" calculates the sum of the squared residuals, the differences between the actual children's heights and the estimated heights specified by the line defined by the given parameters
#When varying the slope and intercept values of the regression line (fit$coef), the resulting squared residuals are approximatel equal to the sum of two sums os squares
> sqe(ols.slope+sl,ols.intercept+ic) == deviance(fit) + sum(est(sl,ic)ˆ2 )

#Equivalently
> sqe(ols.slope+sl,ols.intercept+ic) == sqe(ols.slope, ols.intercept) + sum(est(sl,ic)ˆ2 )

#Extracting the intercept from fit$coef[1], and namign it "ols.ic"
> ols.ic <- fit$coef[1]

#Extracting slope from fit$coef[2]
> ols.slope <- fit$coef[2]

#Variation of children's heights and naming it varChild
> varChild <- var(galton$child)

#Variation in fit$residuals, and naming it varRes
> varRes <- var(fit$residuals)

#Calculating the variance in the estimates and naming it "varEst"
>varEst <- var(est(ols.slope, ols.ic))

#Comparing varChild and the sum of varRes and varEst
> all.equal(varChild,varEst+varRes)
