#Today I will try to create a Recursive Function to make the Fibonacci Sequence
#The fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, the other terms are the sum from the previous terms
#I found a code on website "https://www.datamentor.io/r-programming/examples/fibonacci-recursion/"
#The challenge will be understand the code and try to run properly on my RStudio, because it wasn't working at first

> if(n <= 1)
#Error because I still haven't assigned the N term
# the nth term is the sum of (n-1)th and (n-2)th term
> recurse_fibonacci <- function(n)
>if(n <= 1), return(n)
} else {
  return(recurse_fibonacci(n-1) + recurse_fibonacci(n-2))
}
#Error on the coding

> recurse_fibonacci <- function(n)
  + if(n <= 1) {return(n)}

#Established function recurse_fibonacci

> }else {
> return(recurse_fibonacci(n-1) + recurse_fibonacci(n-2))

#I closed all the {} and coded at the same line
>recurse_fibonacci <- function(n){if(n <= 1) {return(n)} else {return(recurse_fibonacci(n-1) + recurse_fibonacci(n-2))}}

#Now, the second part consists in telling the program when to stop
nterms = as.integer(readline(prompt="How many terms? "))

#The number has to be positive and not fraccioned
>if(nterms <= 0) {print("Plese enter a positive integer")} else {print("Fibonacci sequence:")for(i in 0:(nterms-1)) {print(recurse_fibonacci(i))}}

#I don't know why this line is not working properly
#Also, I can't test the end of the coding yet
#Tomorrow I will try to fiz this problem at daily R
