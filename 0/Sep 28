#Today I will try to solve a problem I'm having with R Studio. I had to restore my computer on the weekend, and since then R is not working properly
#Every time I try to excecute package swirl(), for example, the following message appears: "Error in swirl() : could not find function "swirl"
#First I will try to find Swirl at the installed packages list
> installed.packages()

#Swirl is not on the list
#Try to install swirl again
> install.packages("swirl")
package ‘swirl’ successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked

The downloaded binary packages are in
C:\Users\OS\AppData\Local\Temp\Rtmp4ENRDN\downloaded_packages

#I recieved the advice os trying function .libpaths to change the directory
> .libPaths("C:\Users\OS\Documents\R\win-library\4.1")
Error: '\U' used without hex digits in character string starting ""C:\U"

> swirl()
Error in swirl() : could not find function "swirl"

#I googled how to solve a problem when the message "Error: '\U' used without hex digits in character string starting ""C:\U""
#One way to solve this problem would be type double backlash

#test function swirl()again
> swirl()
Error in swirl() : could not find function "swirl"

#I googled the message "Error in swirl() : could not find function "swirl"
#At "https://github.com/swirldev/swirl/issues/499" I found out that other people had the same issue, and proceeded as the following:
> install.packages("swirl", dependencies = TRUE)
Error in install.packages : Updating loaded packages

Restarting R session...

#After that I try to run swirl again
> library(swirl)
> swirl()

#Success!! The program is running fine again
