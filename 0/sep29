#Today I will take the course "Exploratory Data Analysis: The basics of exploring data in R" of Swirl

> data("cars")
> head(cars)

#Using command "with" to plot with two arguments
> with(cars, plot(speed, dist))

#Now it's possible to see the relationship between the two variables, speed and distance. 
#Using function "text" with mean(cars$speed) on the x coordinates, and max(cars$dist), and the text "Deanivea Plot" at the string
> text(mean(cars$speed),max(cars$dist),"Deanivea Plot!")

#Second plot system, for that I have to install the Lattice System 
> install.packages(lattice)
> data(state)
> head(state)

#Running the command table with the argument state$region to see how many categories there are and how many states are in each
> table(state$region)

#using the lattice command xyplot to see how life expectancy varies with income in each of the four regions
> xyplot(Life.Exp ~ Income | region, data = state, layout = c(4, 1))

#The south of the US has the shortest life expectancy

#Plotting with ggplot2
> install.packages("ggplot2")
> data("mpg")
> head(mpg)
> dim(mpg)
> table(mpg$model)
> qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg)
