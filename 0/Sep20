#Starting Learning the concept of regression toward the mean

#This is a module from Swirl courses ("Regression Models: The Basics of Regression Modeling in R", Introduction). 

#Data is from John Verzani's website, http://wiener.math.csi.cuny.edu/UsingR/

#Or install Swirl and choose the correct module to download data
> plot(child ~ parent, galton)

#Using function "jutter" on the children's heights to spread out the data, to stimulate the measurement errors and make high frequency heights more visible.
> plot(jitter(child,4) ~ parent, galton)

#Dependent variable (children's heights) and independent variable (parent's heights)
> regrline <- lm(child ~ parent, galton)
> abline(regrline, lwd = 3, col = 'red')

#Examining the Galton regression line
> summary(regrline)

#The slope of the regression line is: .64629
#The standard error of the slope is: .04114
