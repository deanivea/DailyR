#Today I'm starting a course on EDX called "Startistics and R" from HarvardX
#This Daily R is related with the previous one, which I tried to import Data from a CSV file
#I took the file from Genomicsclass/dagdata/inst/extdata
#The name of the file is femaleMiceWeights.csv, I downloaded it raw and saved in the same directory of this project
#I also downloaded femaleControlsPopulation and mice_pheno
> ?read.csv
> dat <- read.csv("femaleMiceWeights.csv")

#Installing the dplyr package and exploring the file
> install.packages("dplyr")
> library(dplyr)
> View(dat)
> controls <- filter(dat, Diet== "chow")
> View(controls)
> select(controls, Bodyweight)
> controls <- select(controls, Bodyweight)
> unlist(controls)

controls <- filter(dat, Diet== "chow") %>% select(Bodyweights) %>% unlist
